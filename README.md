The PAJ6100 OpenMV Shield, specially developed by PixArt, allows developers to easily evaluate QVGA (320x240) Global Shutter image sensors for machine-vision applications.

This OpenMV Shield is equipped with a QVGA sensor module that has an ultra-low power consumption rate, makes it particularly suitable to be designed into battery-powered applications. The package adopts LGA architecture with a lens design that supports a field of view of 90 degrees (diagonally). It also support the direct SMT process in full (i.e. a re-flowable module device).

PixArt PAJ6100 OpenMV Shield is designed to be used with the OpenMV H7 platform and is programmable in Python to allow for access to sensor functional parameters (i.e exposure time, resolution, ROI, etc.). Developers can utilize this platform environment to develop machine vision applications, taking advantage of the ultra low power vision sensor that PAJ6100U6 offers. 



Note: 

PixArt will provide all the relevant firmware and reference documents that enable our developers to operate the PAJ6100U6 OpenMV Shield on the OpenMV H7 platform.
